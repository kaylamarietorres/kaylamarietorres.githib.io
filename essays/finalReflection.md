# Open Source Software 
***"Open source software is software with its source code made available and licensed with specific permissions granting users the freedom to study, modify, and distribute the software to anyone for any purpose."***


The "open" aspect implies transparency and accessibility to the underlying code, enabling users to inspect, modify, and enhance the software according to their needs. 
Open source software embodies *transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity.* 

### Copyright

Copyright is a temporary monopoly granted by governments to creators, allowing them control over the distribution of their works. For example, books are covered by copyright for a specific duration, and while you can buy and read a copyrighted book, you are prohibited to distribute copies to others. However, the author gets little say on how the content of the book is used. Similar to books, source code is copyrighted and the author decides to distributed it if they want to. 

### GPL and Copyleft
The GPL (GNU General Public License) implements *Copyleft*, aiming to counteract copyright for collaborative software development. Under the GPL, recipients of source code have rights to use, redistribute, and create derivative works with the condition that the source code remains open and is licensed under the GPL. This license leverages copyright law to encourage open collaboration, allowing contributions from anyone but relying on the copyright holder to enforce the GPL. The Free Software Foundation suggests authors assign copyright to them for stronger legal protection of the GPL, although opinions on this approach vary among individuals in the software community.

### Open Source Development 
While open source licensing makes collaborative software development easier, not all projects effectively operate as open source, sometimes failing to engage users and developers. The Prime Directives for Open Source Software Engineering serve as benchmarks to assess a project's potential success in the open source realm. These directives emphasize three key aspects: first, the software should accomplish a useful task, prioritizing incremental development to deliver essential functionality early on, ideally within weeks of project initiation and assessed by external users. Secondly, the software must be easily installable and usable by external users, supported by adequate user-level documentation and preferably available in an executable form for convenient access. Lastly, the system should enable external developers to understand and enhance it, requiring developer-level documentation that offers insights into the system's design and development. Verification of meeting these directives cannot be done by the system developer alone but requires assessment by external users and developers, ensuring a project's potential to thrive within the open source community.
