I am a complete newbie to JavaScript. After completing FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript and ES6 modules I can confidently say that I enjoy what I have seen from this coding language this far. Compared to other object-oriented programming languages like Java, I enjoy that this language is considered to have first class functions. Furthermore, first class functionality in a programming language is valuable because you are able to use the function anywhere, not just in a specific class. JavaScript is a good programming language because its easy and versatile for new learners. I enjoy the fact that you don't have to declare a variable to use it. It can be overwhelming for new coders to learn many specifics of variable types before diving into the meatier parts of coding. And, not having to configure an entire coding environment when getting started makes it very beginner-friendly along with it using an interpreter meaning that it tests the code before the whole program has been put together which helps coders to catch errors early on. Moreover, the simplicity of the syntax, and with a personal background in Java it felt very easy to pick up on the commonalities between the two languages. In that way JavaScript feels like Java's cool older brother (if that was a thing). 

The athletic software engineering (WOD) part of this class is very interesting to me, and the first WOD I completed before the DNF time was just today in class. The two previous WODs I was not able to finish in time, and I remember not really having a clear plan of action either. I think as time has gone on, I have been getting used to these exercises, and it has been beneficial to me because I'm strengthening the muscle that helps me code on demand. Which is useful in career settings for the interview process. 

I thought it would be more stressful, but today I found myself feeling cool and collected while I finished one minute under the DNF time. I definitely enjoyed today's WOD, and felt very proud of myself for finishing for the first time since beginning these exercises. I do think this style of learning will work for me, and I'm excited for the future WODs and seeing myself finish faster over time.
