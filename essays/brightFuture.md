From a young age I enjoyed solving math and science problems so I knew I was drawn to a more technical career. On the other hand I always pursued creative endeavors like pottery or embroidery. Furthermore, I used my technical skills to teach myself how to create embroidery files of anything I wanted to create, to upload directly to a sewing machine so it would bring my design to life. Needless to say, my grandmother thinks I'm a technology guru, although I know I am far from it (for now).

My interest in software engineering begins with what I imagine my future to look like. They say that the three most important choices you can make in your life is where you live, who you are with, and what your career is. So, I thought about knocking two birds out with one stone and learning how to code in order to have greater flexibility in my career and where I choose to live. I feel as though learning to code can give me a work-life balance that I imagine for myself in the future. Furthermore, I wanted to choose a career that had a bright future, and because this is a growing field there is a demand to be filled of workers. And with everything changing and evolving, I am confident I will maintain my interest in this career.

Computer Science is a broad field and I'm learning that theres a lot of opportunities that I can pursue, I just have to choose which path in this field I want to go down. I am at a point in my degree where I am getting to experience all of the different coding languages and seeing which one clicks with me the most. So far, JavaScript has quickly come to one of the top spots in my list. I enjoy its ease of use and user-friendly interface. It is a great language for beginners to learn. With this in mind I have been thinking about whether software engineering may be for me... It is still early in the game to know for sure, but I may have found 'the one'.
