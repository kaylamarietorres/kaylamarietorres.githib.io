<h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming ever present as we make our way through college, everyone seems to be using it these days. But are our uses of AI holding us back or truly helping us? Are we becoming more comfortable taking shortcuts?</p>
<h2 id="ii-personal-experience-with-ai">II. Personal Experience with AI</h2>
<h3 id="experience-wod">Experience WOD</h3>
<p>During an experience WOD I would use ChatGPT if I needed to fix a small error in my code that I was stumped on. For example, I would copy and paste my code into ChatGPT in order to get feedback on any error there might be in my code. I wanted a quick answer and I wouldn’t spend much time on it because I knew if I needed it there was a video at the bottom of the experience WOD to help me. If the help wasn’t fast and quick, I would move on to the video. I’m aware that the point of the experience WODs are to be able to complete them on my own in the time given and that I was able to submit multiple tries to solidify the concept and process in my head, similar to muscle memory.</p>
<h3 id="in-class-practice-wods">In class practice WODs</h3>
<p>For help on the in class practice WODs I would use ChatGPT if I really thought it would help, but most of the time our WODs were so niche, that ChatGPT wouldn’t know how to help. For example, creating the Murphys Bar &amp; Grill react mockup, I wouldn’t ever know what prompt to write to get help with formatting the style.css for the website.</p>
<h3 id="in-class-wods">In class WODs</h3>
<p>During our in class WODs, I would use ChatGPT if I knew I was close in my code to the answer, but there was a small error that I hadn’t seen before. But for the most part I would not use the help of Artificial Intelligence in the in class WODs because I always made it a point to complete the in class practice WODs and the practice WODs held by the TAs throughout the week. So usually I was able to complete them without needing outside help.</p>
<h3 id="essays">Essays</h3>
<p>If I needed more clarity in writing essays I would use ChatGPT to see how it would make my writing sound more professional. But for the most part it would not help, because it would just make my writing sound too robotic, or too perfect, which both make it look like I obviously used it for help.</p>
<h3 id="final-project">Final project</h3>

<h3 id="learning-a-concept--tutorial">Learning a concept / tutorial</h3>
<p>When learning a concept I would definitely get help by asking ChatGPT if I had no other resources to help me, or if I didn’t know what my other resources were. However, I am aware it is not a perfect AI tool by any means, but as a beginner coder, it would help me understand software engineering concepts that I did not know more about previously.</p>

<p>For example, here I wrote to ChatGPT: “Give me an example of object-oriented programming”</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Define a class called 'Car'
class Car:
    # Constructor method to initialize object attributes
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.is_running = False  # Additional attribute to track if the car is running

    # Method to start the car
    def start(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            self.is_running = True
            print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} has started.")
        else:
            print("The car is already running.")

    # Method to stop the car
    def stop(self):
        if self.is_running:
            self.is_running = False
            print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} has stopped.")
        else:
            print("The car is already stopped.")


# Create instances (objects) of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car2 = Car("Tesla", "Model S", 2022)

# Accessing object attributes and methods
print(f"Car 1: {car1.year} {car1.make} {car1.model}")
car1.start()  # Start car1
car1.start()  # Try to start car1 again
car1.stop()   # Stop car1

print("\n")

print(f"Car 2: {car2.year} {car2.make} {car2.model}")
car2.start()  # Start car2
car2.stop()   # Stop car2
car2.stop()   # Try to stop car2 again

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>For a beginner, I think this was a pretty good tutorial on OOP.</p>
<h3 id="answering-a-question-in-class-or-discord">Answering a question in class or Discord</h3>
<p>I would not use AI for answering a question in class because I would not feel like I knew enough or had the confidence to answer a question in class. On Discord, the same goes because I would not feel that I was qualified enough to answer questions unless I had experienced the same problem, then I would speak on it from direct experience but never would I use AI to  help with that.</p>
<h3 id="asking-or-answering-a-smart-question">Asking or answering a smart question</h3>
<p>When getting help on homework, I would ask ChatGPT before I would get help on the #smart_questions channel on Discord. This was because I felt there was a stigma toward constant asking for help in those channels and being labelled as a “help vampire” or something similar. So if I could get my question answered with AI, I would choose that over going to Discord.</p>
<h3 id="coding-example">Coding example</h3>
<p>Yes I would use ChatGPT to give me a coding example, similar to the OOP example shown above. I would use it because I feel like AI can give helpful examples on certain concepts.</p>
<h3 id="explaining-code">Explaining code</h3>
<p>Yes, if I had code that didn’t have enough comment blocks, I would copy and paste it into ChatGPT and write “Write detailed comments on each line of code” in order to gain an understanding on what each line of code is doing.</p>
<h3 id="writing-code">Writing code</h3>
<p>If I needed a starting outline of code to write for a certain assignment, and searched the internet for help with no avail, then I would go to ChatGPT to get a sense of where to start.</p>
<h3 id="documenting-code">Documenting code</h3>
<p>I’m not exactly sure what documenting code is referring to, but if it is things like comments or explanations of what certain code is doing then yes I would use AI for that if I needed help.</p>
<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality assurance</h3>
<p>Yes, sometimes I did need help with quality assurance this semester. Being a beginner to JavaScript, sometimes I could not identify the errors in my code. I think it takes lots of time and experience with a coding language to be able to debug on your own without help from outside sources. When I could not figure out certain errors I would copy and paste it into ChatGPT without any comments and almost immediately it would be able to show me the error in its response, which was very convenient when I needed help on the fly.</p>
<h3 id="other-uses">Other uses</h3>
<p>That is almost all of my uses with AI in this class. I would specifically only use ChatGPT, and it would be for understanding concepts, creating comments, writing basic code, or revising code.</p>
<h2 id="iii-impact-on-learning-and-understanding">III. Impact on learning and understanding</h2>
<p>I can’t tell if AI has helped my learning throughout this course or stunted it. I know it’s not perfect but when you feel shamed asking for help in outside places, or don’t have many friends in the field you are working in, it can be one of your only resources of help.</p>
<h2 id="iv-practical-applications">IV. Practical Applications</h2>
<p>AI can be used for healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and more. AI is used in healthcare for diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, drug discovery, personalized medicine, and analyzing medical images (MRI, CT scans) for better accuracy and second opinions. AI and machine learning algorithms can be used for self-driving cars, autonomous drones, enabling them to perceive their environment, make decisions and navigate without human intervention.</p>
<h2 id="v-challenges-and-opportunities">V. Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
<p>AI lacks contextual understanding regarding abstract or nuanced subjects, therefore it can give you false information sometimes. And, because AI relies on data quality and quantity. If the data is biased, incomplete, or unrepresentative, AI models can produce inaccurate or biased results which can affect their ability to learn certain concepts accurately.</p>
<h2 id="vi-comparitive-analysis">VI. Comparitive Analysis</h2>
<p>Considering engagement, I think that traditional teaching methods can enhance student engagement farther than AI -enhanced approaches. I think that it is more engaging to come to a classroom to learn and interact with people, than to learn fully from an AI based model behind a computer screen. For knowledge retention, I’m not sure whether AI is helping students retain certain knowledge or not. If we constantly need to rely on an AI based model, are we retaining anything truly? As far as practical skill development, I think that as long as we are practicing constantly we will enhance and develop our software engineering skills, similar to muscle memory that I mentioned previously. If we don’t use it, we’ll lose it!</p>
<h2 id="vii-future-considerations">VII. Future Considerations</h2>
<p>I think that AI can possibly help personalize learning for students, giving specific content and immediate feedback. This could be through AI teaching assistants who can help in grading, providing more resources, and alleviating burdens on instructors. AI can possibly help enhance curriculum, but I think it would need human approval because of the lack or contextualization mentioned earlier.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The role of AI in software engineering education has a long way to go, and we still need to show hard data of if it’s helping students learn or not. Are we getting better software engineers or lazier ones? I think the future can be promising, but the current concerns outweigh any promising future it may have until more developments and studies can be made.</p>
